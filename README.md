As a back-end or full-stack engineer I worked at several early-stage startups, usually as one of the first few employees. I was designing systems from scratch, while gaining experience in BLE technologies, container orchestration, web frameworks and data streaming stacks. _Languages: Go, Python, JavaScript._
